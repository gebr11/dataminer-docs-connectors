# Raisecom ISCOM 2900

## About

The **Raisecom ISCOM 2900** connector integrates Raisecom devices into monitoring platforms via the SNMP protocol. It supports both *ISCOM 29XX* and *RAX 7XX* series, providing visibility into system metrics, hardware health, and optical transceiver data. This information is available through the internal pages, where it is organized into corresponding tables and parameters for structured access and analysis.

Additionally, the connector supports SNMP trap communication, delivering real‑time event notifications, primarily related to device shutdowns and other critical events.


## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default 161.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### SNMP Connection - Traps

For trap handling, the connector requires similar input parameters:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default 162.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

To start retrieving data with the Raisecom SNMP Connector, the user must first validate the Device Type parameter. By default, the connector is configured for the ISCOM 29XX series; however, this setting can be modified to support devices from the RAX 27XX series when required.

Once configured, the connector automatically populates the relevant parameters and tables, providing a consolidated view of device performance and health metrics.
